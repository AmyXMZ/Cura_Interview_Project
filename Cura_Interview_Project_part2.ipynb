Here’s how three of these traits contribute to successful pollination:\\n\\n1. **Lightness**: The light weight of pollen grains allows them to be easily carried by wind or by pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and other insects. This increases the likelihood that pollen will travel from one flower to another, facilitating cross-pollination, which is essential for genetic diversity in plants.\\n\\n2. **Smooth Surface**: The smooth texture of pollen grains helps them adhere to the bodies of pollinators. When a pollinator visits a flower to collect nectar, pollen grains stick to their legs and bodies due to their smooth surface. As the pollinator moves'}, {'question_id': '1416fb52-5eb6-4402-ac8c-498b5cc87da8', 'generated_answer': 'In the experiment, the opaque objects that reflected light included the aluminum foil and the metal spoon. \\n\\nI know this because when I directed the LED flashlight at these materials, I observed that they produced a bright reflection of light rather than allowing any light to pass through. This is characteristic of reflective surfaces, which bounce light away instead of absorbing it or allowing it to transmit through.\\n\\nTo summarize:\\n- **Opaque objects that reflected light**: Aluminum foil and metal spoon.\\n- **Explanation**: The shiny surfaces of these materials caused them to reflect light rather than absorb it or allow it to pass through, demonstrating their reflective properties.'}, {'question_id': '0e4305e5-9436-42e6-aa91-0d417d0e6b7b', 'generated_answer': 'To create a bathroom window that allows light in while providing privacy, I would use frosted glass or a translucent material. Frosted glass is ideal because it scatters the light that passes through it, preventing clear visibility from outside while still allowing natural light to illuminate the space. This ensures that the bathroom remains bright and welcoming without compromising privacy. \\n\\nTranslucent materials, such as certain types of plastic or treated glass, could also be suitable for this purpose as they allow some light to pass through but obscure detailed images, making them effective for maintaining privacy. \\n\\nIn summary, frosted glass or translucent materials are the best choices for a bathroom window because they balance the need for light with the necessity of privacy.'}, {'question_id': 'e2ff5709-711c-487a-b4ef-032473532b2d', 'generated_answer': \"In the ‘unbelted’ crash test, car passengers fly forwards when the car crashes and comes to a sudden stop due to the principle of inertia, which is a key component of Newton's first law of motion.

    "In part 1 of this project, I began by estimating the number of tokens needed for input and output for each question. The average output token count is 68, with a median of 52.5 tokens. The minimum and maximum output token counts appear to be outliers in this case. Therefore, in part 2 of the fine-tuning process, I adjusted the parameter max_tokens to 100, 150, and 200 to observe how the evaluation metrics BERTScore and ROUGE-L fluctuate. I used these two metrics because they measure different aspects of the \"quality\" of the generated output texts. BERTScore is more sophisticated as it measures semantic similarity and pays less attention to word order, relying on cosine similarity. In contrast, ROUGE-L measures the exact text overlap between the generated output and the reference exemplar answers, giving a rough idea of how closely the generated output aligns with the reference. However, its limitation is that it does not account for order, context, or semantics as BERTScore does. Nevertheless, both metrics offer unique insights into the quality of the generated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the statistics of the token count for the exemplar answers in the training dataset, it seems that most exemplar answer tokens cluster around 50–70 (since the average is 68 tokens and the median is 52.5). Therefore, I hypothesized that setting max_tokens close to this cluster (i.e., 50–70) would yield better BERTScore and ROUGE scores. Indeed, when max_tokens = 100 (it may be worth lowering this further in future tests, such as to 80), I achieved the best BERTScore F1 score of 0.57. There was an increase in precision but a decrease in recall compared to when max_tokens = 150, suggesting that the model is better at avoiding irrelevant content with a capped token limit, though at the cost of omitting some relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "When max_tokens = 200, as expected, I obtained the lowest BERTScore F1 of 0.563 but the highest BERTScore Recall of 0.6368. This again confirms that the model faces a trade-off between generating concise but potentially less relevant answers and longer, more relevant answers. However, surprisingly, I obtained the lowest ROUGE score (0.198) when max_tokens = 200. Given the high token limit (200), I expected the model to produce more relevant content with higher text overlap, and therefore a higher ROUGE score. However, this may indicate that the model generates text with similar semantics rather than exact wording from the exemplar answers, which the ROUGE metric does not fully capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also fine-tuned other parameters, such as temperature, top_p, and presence penalty (there are more parameters like frequency penalty that I have not yet tested). Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness and \"creativity\" of the model's output; the higher the value, the more random the generated content. However, for this project, since most of the exemplar answers are fact-based, a highly random and creative output is not ideal. After adjusting the temperature to 0.1, 0.2, and 1, the BERTScore did not show significant change, suggesting that temperature may not impact the actual quality of the texts in this case. I also fine-tuned the presence penalty, but this did not lead to significant change either. Lastly, I adjusted the top_p parameter. A low top_p value can help generate more focused and deterministic answers, which is favorable for this project. However, lowering this value also did not yield a significant change in the BERTScore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another factor I assumed would significantly influence the quality of the generated text was the input text itself. If the input could be more concise, direct, and clear, the quality of the generated output might improve. Therefore, I excluded \"total score\" and \"curriculum codes,\" which are part of the \"rubric,\" from the model input. However, this did not lead to a significant change. In the future, it might be worthwhile to modify item[0] (the highest score answer) to make it more concise and accurately describe what should be included for answers to score the highest. For example, for question 1, item[0] in the rubric, \"I can explain my response\" could be rephrased to \"I can identify which fin design worked best and explain why I think it worked best.\" Although this approach may be somewhat time-consuming, it could enhance clarity."

    "3. for subject areas that the model has not yet been exposed to/trained on (for example, if the model has been extensively trained on data in biology, but not yet been trained in, say, history), have human experts rate on the ouput accuracy, correctness, relevancy in the subject history.
